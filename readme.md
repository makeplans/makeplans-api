## Get started

1) Read this documentation.

2) [Sign up for a trial account in our test environment](https://app.test.makeplans.net/client/new)

3) Go to Setup -> Integrations -> API. Enable the API and get the API-key.

4) Profit.

When your integration is ready to be released you can sign up for a [real account](https://app.makeplans.net/client/new).

Limitations of the test environment:
* SMS reminders are not triggered.
* Very low SMS quota.
* Requests may run slower.
* Bugs may occur during roll out of new features to be tested.
* Lower uptime.
* All financial transactions such as Stripe are performed in their respective test/sandbox environment. Other integrations are performed against real production accounts unless the integration offers a test environment.

## Public and private API

If you are planning to integrate directly from your application to MakePlans or need to modify information in MakePlans then you must use the private API. This API requires authentication with an API-key and should not be done publicly (on a website).

The public API is available for simple read-only operations. This is useful if you want to present information from MakePlans on your website using JavaScript. Because these operations are done on a public website you can not authenticate using your API-key. With the public API you can fetch a list of services, available timeslots and initialize the booking process.

All requests are done over HTTPS. Each object in MakePlans has its own [endpoints](#api-endpoints).

### Base API URL

#### Private API

The base URL is `https://youraccount.makeplans.net/api/` for production apps and `https://youraccount.test.makeplans.net/api/` for test apps.

##### Versioning

The current version of the API is version 1. The versioning scheme is as follows: `/api/v{version_number}/`. All paths in the rest of the document uses `/api/v1/` as base path.

See the [API changelog](changelog.md) for improvements and changes.

#### Public API

The base URL is your account booking site such as `https://youraccount.makeplans.net/`. There is no versioning. Only the latest version of the API is available.

Only read-only operations such as list and show are available with the public API. If you need to modify any data please use the private API.

## Data formats

The API supports JSON for input and output. In addition you can specify input using form data.

The format of the output data is provided as is and the reference is this document.

All data is UTF-8.

All examples and object attributes in this documentation are JSON. They are lowercase and use underscore as separator.

### Output

To specify JSON as output use HTTP-header `Accept: application/json`. Output can also be defined by using extension in the path: `/resources.json` but it is recommended to use `/resources` and specify output format in the HTTP-header. Multiple items is returned as an array.

### Input

To specify JSON as input use HTTP-header `Content-Type: application/json`. The body must be JSON-formatted and include the object with required attributes.

To use normal form data specify HTTP-header `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Form values should be sent like this: `resource[title]=Unicorn`.

## Date handling

All dates are specified in the ISO 8601 format. Time zone is included in the output and specified by the account. It is not necessary to specify time zone in the input as the account time zone will be used as default. The output will give a full ISO 8601 date format with time zone: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD`. For input we recommend that you do not specify time zone unless needed and omit seconds: `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm`.

## Custom data

Custom data is stored as key/value. All values are stored as strings but we do convert boolean values and values from keys ending in `_at` to datetime at output. Custom data can be added to booking, person, service, resource and event. If you are using our standard booking site and would like to store custom data to a new booking please see [the custom forms documentation](https://github.com/makeplans/makeplans-custom-forms) for details on how to customise the booking form.

*Warning*: Custom data is stored as one attribute. **All** keys and values must be present when updating. If a booking has stored `custom_data` as `makeplans_is=awesome` and you want to add `signup=now` then you need to include both `makeplans_is` and `signup` with their values.

## Authentication

Use your account API-Key to authenticate with the MakePlans API. First enable the API on the account and you will find the API-Key in the account settings.

Send the API-Key as a Bearer token using the HTTP Authorization header.

Example: `Authorization: Bearer APIKEY`

Deprecated: For Basic Auth use the API-Key as username and empty password.

If your application is installable by end-users you should use oAuth. However we do not yet support oAuth so please contact us if this is something you require.

## Identification

You must include a User-Agent HTTP-header with the name of your application and a link to it or your email address so we can get in touch in case you're doing something wrong (so we may warn you before you're blocked) or something awesome (so we may congratulate you). Example: `User-Agent: YourAppName (http://example.org)`.

## Rate limiting

We do various forms of rate limiting. See details for [HTTP status code 429](#too-many-requests).

## Errors

4xx HTTP status codes means you made a mistake and you need to adjust your request.

### 400 - Bad Request

API usage error. This means you did something wrong and there should be a message in the body that explains it. Error message is related to specified resource. Fix it and try again.

Example response:

```json
{
  "title": [
  "is a required field. Cannot be empty"
  ]
}
```

### 401 - Unauthorized

Authentication error. Response body will give explanation if there is authorisation issue or if the API is not enabled.

### 402 - Payment Required

Please pay your bill.

### 403 - Forbidden

Authorization error. If you are authenticated but lack permissions.

### 404 - Not Found

Obviously incorrect paths (`/cats`) returns 404. However, even though cool URIs should not change, previously available objects, lets say `/resources/666`, might have been deleted and thus return a 404 when requested. In most cases deleted resources will be returned and have a booking state or a flag that indicate that the resource is inactive or deleted.

### 429 - Too Many Requests

You can perform up to 80 requests per 20 second period from the same IP address. If you exceed this limit, you'll get a 429 Too Many Requests response for subsequent requests. Check the `Retry-After` HTTP-header to see how many seconds to wait before retrying the request.

### 5xx - Server error

System errors (aka we screwed up) returns 5xx HTTP status codes without any detailed information. We log all system errors, but please contact us if you get this response.

```json
{
  "error": "system error"
}
```

## Pagination

Maximum 50 items are returned per response for all endpoints except `bookings` which returns 750. Specify page with parameter `page`. Pagination is used for: bookings, events, people and resource exception dates. All other objects return all available items. Please note that currently there is no way to specify exact part of the dataset. Thus an item might appear in both page 2 and 3 if the complete dataset for the query has changed.

RFC-8288 is used for pagination linking. You will find URLs for first, prev, next and last pages in the `Link` HTTP Header. In addition metadata is added in the following HTTP Headers: `Current-Page`, `Page-Items`, `Total-Count`, `Total-Pages`.

## Example request and response

```shell
curl -u APIKEY: \
-H 'User-Agent: YourAppName (http://example.org)' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
https://youraccount.test.makeplans.net/api/v1/services
```

To create something you have to make a POST:

```shell
curl -u APIKEY: \
-H 'User-Agent: YourAppName (http://example.org)' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d 'service[title]=My new service!&service[interval]=40' \
-X POST \
https://youraccount.test.makeplans.net/api/v1/services
```

## Synchronisation

Synchronising data is hard. Please ensure you test before releasing to production. First pick either MakePlans or the other system as a master. If the other system is chosen as a master then we recommend enabling the 'confirmation by administrator' setting for bookings. The synchronisation should then retrieve unprocessed bookings and process them (confirm/decline). This will ensure you can handle any changes occurred in the other system since the last synchronisation with MakePlans. New unprocessed bookings must be processed often (every 1-5 minutes) to ensure confirmations are sent out quickly to the end-user after requesting a new reservation.

**NEVER** delete any data in MakePlans to make it easier to adapt to the other system. MakePlans is a customer facing booking application. End-users (stored as people) can change and cancel bookings, thus any modifications or destruction of core data should not occur. Bookings are stored with a history (log) and there is a link between a person and bookings. MakePlans make use of this data and all this data must be kept to ensure the booking process in MakePlans works as expected for the end-user.

Expect all booking and person data to be changed at any time. All changes for an object will result in a updated attribute `updated_at`.

We recommend storing a timestamp for when the synchronisation was last performed. When the synchronisation is performed again this timestamp can be used to fetch any changes on the `updated_at` attribute for the object you want to retrieve (e.g. the parameter `since` for bookings).

## API libraries

MakePlans does not officially support API libraries but they might be useful for you. Please note that these projects are **not** made by MakePlans but made publicly available by other developers who have used the MakePlans API. Any questions should be made directly to the responsible developers. If you find any errors or areas of improvement please make a pull request to improve the project.

A big thanks to everyone who has contributed to these libraries!

## Webhooks

A webhook is simply a user-defined callback in the form of an HTTP POST which is invoked when something happens.
So for example whenever a new booking is created in MakePlans we can send a POST request to the URL you specify. The response will include data about the modified object.

### Payload

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>object</td><td>String</td><td>Type of object</td></tr>
  <tr><td>event</td><td>String</td><td>Type of event</td></tr>
  <tr><td>id</td><td>Integer</td><td>Id of the object</td></tr>
  <tr><td>*object_type*</td><td>Object</td><td>Payload of the object</td></tr>
  <tr><td>idempotency_id</td><td>String</td><td>Unique id for this webhook</td></tr>
  <tr><td>generated_at</td><td>String</td><td>When the event was initialized</td></tr>
  <tr><td>performed_by</td><td>Object</td><td>Info of the user who performed the event</td></tr>
</table>

### Supported events

* booking.cancelled
* booking.confirmed
* booking.created
* booking.declined
* booking.deleted
* booking.modified
* booking.verified
* event.created
* event.deleted
* event.modified
* person.created

### Wildcard usage

You can use wildcard to trigger all or grouped events: `*` or `booking.*`

### Security

#### Verify payload signature

We include a `X-MakePlans-Signature` header in the webhook request. Use this to verify the request body to ensure the request is from MakePlans and signed with your account secret. The header includes details about the signature and the signature itself. We use HMAC SHA-256 to compute this signature.

Example: `X-MakePlans-Signature:sha256=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd`.

#### Authentication

You can add HTTP Basic Auth credentials or a parameter secret to the webhook URL.

### Retries

We will retry after any 4xx or 5xx http status response. Maximum retries are 5. The timeout is set to 10 seconds.

## API Endpoints

## Slots

Slots are not physical objects in MakePlans. It is a virtual representation of available times based on attributes from resources and services. So if a resource is open 8am to 4pm and selected service has interval of 60 minutes, slots will return an array of all time intervals (8am-9am, 9am-10am etc.) and indicate which resources are available.

Slots are meant for listing available times on the MakePlans booking page. You can however make bookings at any time and with any length - as long as the resource is available off course.

  <tr><td>formatted_timestamp_end</td><td>String</td><td>Localised human readable format</td></tr>
  <tr><td>free</td><td>Integer</td><td>Free capacity</td></tr>
  <tr><td>available_resources</td><td>Array</td><td>Ids of resources with availability</td></tr>
  <tr><td>maximum_capacity</td><td>Integer</td><td>The maximum capacity of the available resources</td></tr>

### States

* awaiting_verification
* verification_expired
* awaiting_payment
* awaiting_confirmation
* confirmed
* declined
* cancelled
* deleted

#### Normal state flow

The normal booking flow when a customer initiates a new booking starts with `awaiting_verification`. If verification is required MakePlans sends out email or SMS for the customer to verify. When successfully verified the state is updated to `confirmed` or `awaiting_confirmation` if reservations requires confirmation by administrator. For confirmation it is then updated to `confirmed` as normally if confirmed, and to `declined` if it is not confirmed.

Bookings that have been confirmed and then cancelled, either by customer or administrator, are set to `cancelled`.

Bookings that are deleted are set to `deleted`.

### Active bookings

Bookings with states `awaiting_verification`, `awaiting_payment`, `awaiting_confirmation` or `confirmed` are considered to be active. Bookings with state `awaiting_verification` will be updated with state `verification_expired` after the current time passes `expires_at`. However updating states rely on automatic tasks so you must use the `active` attribute to check whether a booking is active or not. Only active bookings will be returned unless you specify: a booking by id, a specific state such as bookings that are awaiting confirmation, to return all bookings for a resource or dates, or for a person.

### Listing

See query parameters for filtering the output beyond the default outputs.

`GET /bookings` will return all active bookings.

`GET /bookings/recent` will return all active bookings ordered based on updated_at.

`GET /bookings/upcoming` will return all active bookings from and including `{date}`.

`GET /bookings/unconfirmed` will return only unconfirmed bookings.

`GET /bookings/all` will return all bookings of all states (including `declined`, `cancelled`, `deleted`, and `verification_expired`). This is a useful output for syncronisation when you need to keep a track of deleted bookings.

`GET /bookings/visible` will return all active bookings as well as those declined or cancelled. This is the preferred output if you want to provide a list of all bookings for visual presentation.

  <tr><td>collection_id</td><td>UUID</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

You can return bookings of multiple resources/services/events/people with an array.

### Add new booking

`POST /bookings` will create a new booking.

#### Non-returning booking parameters

These parameters are part of booking: `booking[public_booking]`.

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>public_booking</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Restrict to normal public booking rules such as within opening hours, not able to book in the past or past specified allowed date in the future. Recommended for all customer facing booking applications (e.g. integration on website). Not recommended when synchronising with other calendar programs. Default: false.</td></tr>
</table>

#### Additional parameters

These parameters are part not of `booking[]`: `confirm`.

Outgoing messages requires person_id and service_id.

Default action for outgoing messages is according to the settings for booking verification. If email verification is enabled then all `*_email` messages will be triggered by default to the customer. To override please see parameters for each action below. For admin notification messages the default is based on the account settings. SMS reminders is based on account settings and uses a default value for the time unless specified.

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>confirm</td><td>Boolean</td><td>If set to false then the 'initiate verification' event is executed. If verification is required the state will be set to `awaiting_verification`. If no verification is required then the state will be set to `awaiting_confirmation` or `confirmed`.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ignore_capacity</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Will force save the booking even though other bookings exists within the same time on the specified resource_id (double booking). Not applicable when `public_booking` is set to false (no double bookings allowed). Default: false.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>add_reminder_sms</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Automatically adds `reminder_at` based on setting from account attribute `sms_reminder_time`. Default: at 12PM the day before the appointment.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>add_messages</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Automatically generate messages based on message templates. (NOTE: Beta functionality available by invitation.)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>verification_send_email</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Send out verification email. Only applicable when `confirm` is set to false.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>verification_send_sms</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Send out verification SMS. Only applicable when `confirm` is set to false.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>confirmation_send_email</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Send out confirmation email.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>confirmation_send_sms</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Send out confirmation SMS.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>notification_send_email</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Send out notification email to admin.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>notification_send_sms</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Send out notification SMS to admin.</td></tr>
</table>

#### Add new booking with new person

To add a new person along with a booking you must populate `person_attributes` with [person](#people) attributes. Values will be matched to an existing person based on national id number, phone number or email (in that order).

### Add recurring/multiple bookings

`POST /bookings/recurring` will create a multiple bookings.

The recurrence format follows the [iCalendar specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545). The attributes for recurrence are: `RRULE`, `RDATE`, `EXDATE`. For an introduction and examples of these parameters see [this section from the iCalendar specification](http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html).

In the iCalendar specification the recurrence is based on values in `DTSTART` and `DTEND`. This is set by `booked_from` and `booked_to` from `booking`.

All recurring bookings will except for `booked_from` and `booked_to` have the same attributes based on the specified parameters in `booking`.

All bookings created by the recurring pattern gets the same UUID in `collection_id`. As the collection name implies, and as is possible with the iCalendar specification, this is not necessarily only for recurrence (i.e. 9am-10am each Friday until December 1st) but also for multiple specific times (as can be specified with `RDATE`).

Only the `collection_id` is returned. No bookings are created at the time of request as they will be processed by the server in the background due to the volume of bookings that it is possible to create at one time. A successful response with a `collection_id` does in no way indicate that any bookings will be created. The first booking as defined in `booking` is however validated. If it is not valid errors details are returned in the same way as creating a single booking. In such a case recurring rules are not applied and you must adjust the request until validation is successful.

#### Parameters for recurrence

The parameters for recurrence are not set in `booking` but in `recurrence`.

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>rrule</td><td>String</td><td>Repeating pattern. Example: `FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=19971224T000000Z`.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>rdate</td><td>String</td><td>List of recurring dates. Example: `VALUE=DATE:19970101,19970120,19970217,19970421`.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>exdate</td><td>String</td><td>List of dates that should be excluded from the recurring rule. Example: `VALUE=DATE:19970102`.</td></tr>
</table>

You should always specify COUNT or UNTIL with RRULE. The max number of occurrences is 731, regardless if a limit is set or not.

#### List occurrences

`GET /bookings/recurring/{collection_id}` will return all occurrences for a collection.

#### Delete all occurrences

`DELETE /bookings/recurring/{collection_id}` will delete *all* occurrences for a collection.

### Change booking state

#### Verify a booking

`PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/verify` will verify a booking. The verification code is not checked. Use this when you handle verification in your application.

#### Verify a booking with verification code

`PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/verify_code` will verify a booking using `{verification_code}`. Use this when MakePlans is used to send out verification email or SMS.

### Add new person

`POST /people` will create a new person.

### Update person

`PUT /people/{person_id}` will update existing person with id `{person_id}`.

### Delete person

`DELETE /people/{person_id}` will delete existing person with id `{person_id}`.

### Merge person with another person

`POST /people/{person_id}/merge?merge_person_id={merge_person_id}` will merge existing person with id `{person_id}` and `{merge_person_id}`. All bookings for `{merge_person_id}` will be transferred to `{person_id}`. `{merge_person_id}` will be deleted. You can also specify attributes to update with `{person}` just like when creating/updating a person.

### Person verification with a perishable token

The purpose of this feature is to verify a new or existing person in MakePlans on your website such as "login to see your bookings". The verification can be done either using email or SMS. When successful you will have verified either an email or a phone number. Thus you can either create a new person or retrieve an existing person knowing that the person has been verified.

Please note that this token is perishable, meaning that it will be removed from and unavailable for verification after 10 minutes.

#### Send perishable token

`POST /people/perishable_token/send` will send a SMS with a five digit code (the token) or an email with a link which includes the token in the URL. Specify either `person[email]` or `person[phone_number]`.

*Sending via email is not yet implemented. Only SMS token is possible.*

#### Verify perishable token

`POST /people/perishable_token/verify`. This will return a person if authentication is successful. If the email or phone_number is already registered to a person then that person will be returned. If no person exists with the specified email/phone_number then a empty person object will be returned. You then have to make another call to create the person. If the token and the identifier do not match an error is returned.

Specify the token as `perishable_token` and the identifier in `person[email]` or `person[phone_number]`.

### List bookings for person

`GET /people/{person_id}/bookings` will retrieve all bookings for person with id `{person_id}`. You can also use other listings as described in the [bookings listing](#listing-1) such as `GET /people/{person_id}/bookings/visible` to include cancelled bookings.

## Services

There are two types of services:

* Appointment
* Attendance

Appointments can be booked within fixed opening hours as specified on the Resource and with exceptions specified in ResourceExceptionDate.

Attendance at an event is also a booking but the individual booking datetime or resource cannot be modified. Attendance is linked to an event which occurs at a specific time. One service can be linked to one or multiple events.

```

### Add new service

`POST /services` will create a new service.

### Update service

`PUT /services/{service_id}` will update existing service with id `{service_id}`.

### Delete service

`DELETE /services/{service_id}` will delete existing service with id `{service_id}`. Deleting a service will set it to active=false and will not be returned in any listings.

## Events

Unlike appointments made through a normal service events starts and ends at a specific time. An event is connected to a resource and a service. It could be either a one-off event (e.q. a concert) or something that occurs multiple times (e.q. spinning class). Event bookings have a strong relation to the event. That means that it is not possible to modify details such as `{booked_from}`, `{booked_to}`, `{resource_id}` and `{service_id}` for the `{booking}`. To make such changes it must be done to the event. All bookings connected to the event will then automatically me modified.

While events are connected to a resource bookings or capacity of an event are not restricted by the opening hours or availability of a resource.

### Add new event

`POST /events` will create a new event.

### Add recurring/multiple events

`POST /events/recurring` will create a multiple events.

The recurrence format follows the [iCalendar specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545). The attributes for recurrence are: `RRULE`, `RDATE`, `EXDATE`. For an introduction and examples of these parameters see [this section from the iCalendar specification](http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html).

In the iCalendar specification the recurrence is based on values in `DTSTART` and `DTEND`. This is set by `starts_at` and `ends_at` from `event`.

All recurring events will except for `starts_at` and `ends_at` have the same attributes based on the specified parameters in `event`.

All events created by the recurring pattern gets the same UUID in `collection_id`. As the collection name implies, and as is possible with the iCalendar specification, this is not necessarily only for recurrence (i.e. 9am-10am each Friday until December 1st) but also for multiple specific times (as can be specified with `RDATE`).

Only the `collection_id` is returned. No events are created at the time of request as they will be processed by the server in the background due to the volume of events that it is possible to create at one time. A successful response with a `collection_id` does in no way indicate that any events will be created. The first event as defined in `event` is however validated. If it is not valid errors details are returned in the same way as creating a single event. In such a case recurring rules are not applied and you must adjust the request until validation is successful.

#### Parameters for recurrence

The parameters for recurrence are not set in `event` but in `recurrence`.

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>rrule</td><td>String</td><td>Repeating pattern. Example: `FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=19971224T000000Z`.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>rdate</td><td>String</td><td>List of recurring dates. Example: `VALUE=DATE:19970101,19970120,19970217,19970421`.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>exdate</td><td>String</td><td>List of dates that should be excluded from the recurring rule. Example: `VALUE=DATE:19970102`.</td></tr>
</table>

You should always specify COUNT or UNTIL with RRULE. The max number of occurrences is 731, regardless if a limit is set or not.

#### List occurrences

`GET /events/recurring/{collection_id}` will return all occurrences for a collection.

### Update event

`PUT /events/{event_id}` will update existing service with id `{event_id}`.

### Delete event

`DELETE /events/{event_id}` will delete existing event with id `{event_id}`. Deleting a event will set it to active=false and will not be returned in any listings.

## Resources

### Attributes

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>id</td><td>Integer</td><td>Automatically set</td></tr>
  <tr><td>created_at</td><td>Datetime</td><td>Automatically set</td></tr>
  <tr><td>updated_at</td><td>Datetime</td><td>Automatically set</td></tr>
  <tr><td>title</td><td>String</td><td>Required</td></tr>
  <tr><td>active</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Automatically set</td></tr>
  <tr><td>opening_hours_mon</td><td>Array</td><td>Default opening hours for Monday.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>opening_hours_tue</td><td>Array</td><td>Default opening hours for Tuesday.</td></tr>

  <tr><td>opening_hours_sat</td><td>Array</td><td>Default opening hours for Saturday.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>opening_hours_sun</td><td>Array</td><td>Default opening hours for Sunday.</td></tr>
</table>

#### Default opening hours

Values for the opening hours attributes is of type time in the array. Values are in the form of two's. This results in adding breaks within a day. To define opening hours from 8AM to 4PM with lunch at 12PM to 12.30PM the following array will be the result: `['08:00', '12:00', '12:30', '16:00']`. Having opening hours without a lunch break will yield this result: `['08:00', '16:00']`. To define a weekday as closed the value should be `NULL`.

#### Deprecated Attributes

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>open_0</td><td>Time</td><td>Opening time for Monday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>open_1</td><td>Time</td><td>Opening time for Tuesday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>open_2</td><td>Time</td><td>Opening time for Wednesday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>open_3</td><td>Time</td><td>Opening time for Thursday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>open_4</td><td>Time</td><td>Opening time for Friday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>open_5</td><td>Time</td><td>Opening time for Saturday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>open_6</td><td>Time</td><td>Opening time for Sunday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>close_0</td><td>Time</td><td>Closing time for Monday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>close_1</td><td>Time</td><td>Closing time for Tuesday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>close_2</td><td>Time</td><td>Closing time for Wednesday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>close_3</td><td>Time</td><td>Closing time for Thursday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>close_4</td><td>Time</td><td>Closing time for Friday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>close_5</td><td>Time</td><td>Closing time for Saturday</td></tr>
  <tr><td>close_6</td><td>Time</td><td>Closing time for Sunday</td></tr>
</table>

These deprecated attributes define opening hours without breaks. Given `opening_hours_tue` with a break defined as this: `['08:00', '12:00', '12:30', '16:00']` it would yield `open_1` to be `08:00` and `close_1'` to be `16:00`. These attributes are deprecated and will be removed in a future API version.

### Get opening hours for specific dates

Opening hours for specific dates is based on the standard opening hours that are specified on the resource but can be overridden with entries in [resource exception dates](#resource-exception-dates).

#### Listing

`GET /resources/{resource_id}/opening_hours` will get opening hours on specific dates for resource with id `{resource_id}`.

Response

```json
[
  {
    "resource_opening_hours": {
      "date": "2015-12-03",

```


#### Query Parameters

<table>

  <tr><td>to</td><td>Date</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

### Add new resource

`POST /resources` will create a new resource.

### Update resource

`PUT /resources/{resource_id}` will update existing resource with id `{resource_id}`.

### Delete resource

`DELETE /resources/{resource_id}` will delete existing resource with id `{resource_id}`. Deleting a resource will set it to active=false and will not returned in any listings.

## Resource exception dates

Opening hours for a resource is what is used to generate available slots for a service. It is based on the default opening hours on the resource unless anything else is specified by a resource exception date. So ignore the poorly naming of the feature and treat it as opening hours on dates. If a resource should be closed for a week then you would add resource exception dates. If a resource should have opening hours 08:00 to 14:00 on January 5th 2016 instead of the default opening hours for that weekday which could be 09:00 to 15:00, then add it as a resource exception date. See [resource opening hours](#default-opening-hours) for how to specify.

Exception dates are related to a resource: `GET /resources/{resource_id}/exception_dates`.
